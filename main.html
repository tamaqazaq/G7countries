            <h2>About G7</h2>
             <p>The <strong>Group of Seven (G7)</strong> is an <strong>intergovernmental political and economic forum</strong> consisting of <strong>Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom</strong>, and the <strong>United States</strong>; additionally, the <strong>European Union (EU)</strong> is a <i>"non-enumerated member"</i>. It is organized around shared values of <strong>pluralism, liberal democracy</strong>, and <strong>representative government</strong>. G7 members are major <strong>IMF advanced economies</strong>. Originating from an <strong>ad hoc</strong> gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of <strong>trade, security, economics</strong>, and <strong>climate change</strong>. Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's <strong>Commission President</strong> and <strong>European Council President</strong>, meet annually at the <strong>G7 Summit</strong>; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.</p>              <p>The G7 operates without a formal treaty, permanent secretariat, or official headquarters. Its leadership rotates annually among the member countries, with the presiding nation setting the group's agenda and hosting the annual summit. In 2024, <strong>Italy holds the presidency</strong>. Despite lacking a legal foundation, the G7 is recognized for its considerable global influence. The group has played a key role in driving several major international efforts, such as <strong>fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic</strong>, providing financial support to <strong>developing nations</strong>, and addressing <strong>climate change</strong> through agreements like the <strong>Paris Accord</strong>. Nonetheless, the G7 has faced criticism for its <strong>limited membership</strong>, lack of diversity in global representation, and perceived ineffectiveness. The combined population of the G7 countries is approximately <strong>780 million</strong>, making up nearly <strong>10% of the world's population</strong>. Together, they account for around <strong>50% of global nominal net wealth</strong> and about <strong>30% of the world's GDP</strong> as of 2024. In recent years, there has been ongoing debate about expanding the G7. Some, like <strong>Ronald A. Klain</strong> from the Carnegie Endowment, argue that due to the <strong>Eurocentric nature</strong> of the group and <strong>Japan</strong> being the sole Asian representative, it would make sense to include countries like <strong>South Korea</strong> and <strong>Australia</strong>, transforming the G7 into a <strong>G9</strong>.</p>
